# 701-Coursework

This folder contains the data files and associated ipynb files supporting my 701 coursework project.

QUICKSTART - Simply run the 'SEND Data ML Models FINAL' file with the 'df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv' loaded already

There are five data files, four of which are used to produce the final data file which is used for the machine learning models. To save time it's possible simply to use this one to run the SEND Data ML models ipynb file as suggested above

The fully processed data file is called: 'df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv'

'sen_school_level_underlying_data (1).csv' is used together with ukpostcodes.csv in the 'Mapping school postcodes to latitude, longitude.ipynb'

Please note the Uk postcodes file is too big to upload to github. It is available here: https://www.freemaptools.com/download/full-postcodes/ukpostcodes.zip

Then the resulting dataset 'sch_lat_lon_df.csv' is used with spc_school_level_underlying_data.csv in the file 'SEND Data Pre-processing FINAL.ipynb' this creates 'df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv'
