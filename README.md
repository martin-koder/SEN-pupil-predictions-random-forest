# 701-Coursework

This folder contains the data files and associated ipynb files supporting my 701 coursework project.

QUICKSTART - Simply run the SEND Data ML Models file with the df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv loaded already

There are five data files, four of which are used to produce the final data file which is used for the machine learning models. To save time it's possible simply to use this one to run the SEND Data ML models ipynb file as suggested above

The fully processed data file is called: df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv

sen_school_level_underlying_data (1).csv is used together with ukpostcodes.csv in the Mapping school postcodes to latitude, longitude.ipynb

Then the resulting dataset sch_lat_lon_df.csv is used with spc_school_level_underlying_data.csv in the file SEND Data Pre-processing.ipynb this creates df_merged_with_lat_lon_trimmed_with_ohe_school_types.csv
